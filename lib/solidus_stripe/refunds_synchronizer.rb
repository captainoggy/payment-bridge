module SolidusStripe
  # Synchronizes refunds from Stripe to Solidus.
  #
  # For our use case, Stripe has two ways to inform us about refunds initiated
  # on their side:
  #
  # 1. The `charge.refunded` webhook event, which is triggered when a refund is
  # explicitly created.
  # 2. The `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook event, which is triggered when a
  # payment intent is captured. If the payment intent is captured for less than
  # the full amount, a refund is automatically created for the remaining amount.
  #
  # In both cases, Stripe doesn't tell us which refund was recently created, so
  # we need to fetch all the refunds for the payment intent and check if any of
  # them is missing on Solidus. We're using the `transaction_id` field on
  # `Spree::Refund` to match refunds against Stripe refunds ids. We could think
  # about only syncing the single refund not present on Solidus, but we need to
  # acknowledge concurrent partial refunds.
  #
  # The `Spree::RefundReason` with `SolidusStripe::Config.refund_reason_name`
  # as name is used as created refunds' reason.
  #
  # Besides, we need to account for refunds created from Solidus admin panel,
  # which calls the Stripe API. In this case, we need to avoid syncing the
  # refund back to Solidus on the subsequent webhook, otherwise we would end up
  # with duplicate records. We're marking those refunds with a metadata field on
  # Stripe, so we can filter them out (see {Gateway#credit}).
